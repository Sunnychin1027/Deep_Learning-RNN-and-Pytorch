# Deep_Learning-RNN-and-Pytorch
This file showcases three different methods for building models using TorchVision datasets. 
In this project, we explore three approaches to construct models using TorchVision datasets: Sequential, Class-based, and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).

1. Sequential Approach:
The Sequential approach involves building a model using the torch.nn.Sequential module. This method allows for a straightforward and sequential definition of the model architecture by stacking different layers together.

2. Class-based Approach:
The Class-based approach involves defining a custom class that inherits from the torch.nn.Module class. This method provides more flexibility and control over the model architecture. Creating a custom model class, including the necessary methods such as __init__() and forward().

3. RNN Approach:
The RNN approach focuses on utilizing recurrent neural networks for modeling sequential data. This approach is particularly useful when working with sequential data, such as time series or natural language processing tasks.
